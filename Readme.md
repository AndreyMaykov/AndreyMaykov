## Hi, I am Andrey
Thank you for visiting my GitHub repositories. At the moment, there are five projects presented here.

### <a href="https://github.com/AndreyMaykov/Shipping_resources_availability--SQL">1. Shipping Resources Availability Project &ndash; SQL</a></br><a href="https://github.com/AndreyMaykov/Online_marketplace_shipping--SQL">2. Online Marketplace Shipping Project &ndash; SQL</a>
The goal of these two projects is to provide for shipping resources management functionality of an online marketplace system. To maintain data integrity and facilitate shipment planning, triggers and stored procedures are extensively used. 

### <a href="https://github.com/AndreyMaykov/Square_data_import_automation--Python-SQL-AWS">3. Square Data Import Automation Project &ndash; Python-SQL-AWS</a>
This project aims at developing an automated system for importing data from multiple Square online stores to a destination database. The importation process involves transforming the original data to comply with the specifications of the destination DB. Also, the system ensures automatic data synchronization: whenever a participating merchant alters the catalog of their Square online store, the data in the destination DB is updated accordingly.

**Projects 1 &ndash; 3** are closely related to the development of an e-commerce solution (online marketplace) I was involved in during my work placement at **SwiftRoot Inc**.

### <a href="https://github.com/AndreyMaykov/Weather_factors_in_crime--Redshift-Airflow-Terraform">4. Weather Factors in Crime &ndash; Redshift-Airflow-Terraform</a>
Data pipelines used to study correlations between combinations of weather factors and the incidence of various types of crime must be capable of processing large raw datasets with high temporal and spatial granularity. This simple learning project is meant to be a first phase of building such a data pipeline.


### <a href="https://github.com/AndreyMaykov/The_Klein-Gordon_equation">5. The Klein-Gordon equation &ndash; C++</a>
In this project, a code for numerically solving the initial-boundary problem</br>
![ ](https://github.com/AndreyMaykov/The_Klein-Gordon_equation/blob/main/img/IBPx0.5_cropped.png)</br>
was developed. 

This problem is related to **the Klein-Gordon equation** and is important for testing the so-called **open boundary conditions** (also known as transparent or non-reflecting boundary conditions) for equations that describe electromagnetic or acoustic waves in various media.
